There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good."], "Difficulty": ["Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play."], "Music": ["Terraria\u2019s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music."], "Multiplayer": ["Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn."], "Performance": ["Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times."], "Price": ["Terraria is very inexpensive. It\u2019s one of the few games I\u2019ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it."], "Struggles": ["To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you\u2019ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn\u2019t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can\u2019t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don\u2019t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don\u2019t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.", "My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won\u2019t get every item in the game, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it\u2019s possible to get every item in the game, but it\u2019s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it\u2019ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it\u2019s not fun to abuse these)."], "Tips": ["Organize and name chests ASAP", "Place rope down a Hellevator", "Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators", "The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control", "Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time", "Go fishing. It\u2019s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot", "For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients", "Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms", "Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)"]}}},

Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*[i]Starbound[/i]*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on.
